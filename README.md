# donut-bot

[donut bot](https://www.donut.com/#) is a slack bot that automatically pairs people up in a given channel to have donut times. Recently, I found a need in my own slack workspace to create a donut-bot that would go beyond the free options offered by donut. So I created this simple python script that creates custom message and donut pairing group sizes.
